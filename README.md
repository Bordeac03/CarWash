# CarWash

# Team CRBLA

## Description

Our project is going to basically help people and also car washes and their staff be more efficient with the persons using them. Let’s say you want to go in a certain zone and your car is dirty and you don’t want to show up with it like that so they have a map in our application where all the carwashes in that certain zone or on the way to that destination. How does this help the carwashes or users you may ask, well after a user has chosen a certain car wash he can then choose certain products, which can vary from full wash to only a quick refresh of the car. Before arriving, there will be a button on the dashboard of the client from where he confirms its arrival and receive a QR code and he will also be guided to the ramp for those certain products the user has chosen and at the ramp he will just scan the QR code and enter it. The staff will also get a confirmation on their client application and they know exactly what they have to do for that certain car. This way the carwashes will become more efficient and the clients will be more satisfied with the services they receive.
